                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>
                        The koala is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae, and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of eastern and southern Australia, inhabiting open eucalypt woodlands and forests.
                        Koalas are known for their distinctive appearance, with large round ears, a large black nose, and a stout body covered in thick, soft fur. They primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals, but koalas have a specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify these leaves.
                        Koalas are mostly nocturnal and spend a significant amount of their time sleeping in trees, often up to 18-22 hours a day. They are solitary animals, with each koala having its own home range, although they may share overlapping areas with others.
                        Koalas are an iconic symbol of Australia and are often associated with the country's unique wildlife. However, they face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and disease, leading to concerns about their conservation status. Efforts are ongoing to protect their habitats and ensure the survival of this beloved marsupial.
