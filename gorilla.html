                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gorillas are the largest primates and are known for their strength and intelligence. 
                        They live in groups led by a dominant silverback.
                        Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruit.
                        They are found in the forests of central Africa, particularly in countries like Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
                        Gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease.
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and reduce human-wildlife conflict.
                        Gorillas are known for their complex social structures and strong family bonds.
