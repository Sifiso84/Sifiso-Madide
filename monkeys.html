                    <p>
                        Monkeys are primates that are generally smaller than apes and have long tails. They are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and ability to use tools. Monkeys are found in various habitats, including forests, savannas, and mountains.
                        There are two main types of monkeys: New World monkeys (found in the Americas) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia). Each group has unique characteristics and adaptations to their environments.
                        Monkeys are highly social animals, often living in troops or groups. They communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.
                        Their diet primarily consists of fruits, leaves, seeds, and insects, although some species may also eat small animals.
