                    <p>
                        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterized by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.
                        The giant panda is a conservation reliant vulnerable species. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN, with an estimated 1,864 individuals left in the wild as of 2014.
                        The giant panda is a herbivore, with bamboo making up 99% of its diet. It has a unique digestive system that allows it to extract nutrients from bamboo, but it must consume large quantities to meet its energy needs.
                        Pandas are known for their playful behavior and are often seen climbing trees or rolling around in the grass.
