                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
Giraffes are known for their long necks, which can be up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length, and their distinctive coat patterns, which consist of patches of brown and white or cream.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs. They have a unique way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other, which gives them a distinctive gait.</p>
